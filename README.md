# React Web Application
Getting Started with SBA 320 H
I will be using api from NewsAPI for my application. It has daily 100 request which i think will be sufficient for development process and deployment. 

I have attached SBA 320 wireframe.pdf for my application with this repo. 
--------------------------------
I had to change the API because the api i decided to use did not have enough free requests. Now I am using differnt api and differrent wireframe.
I decided to use api from TheMovieDB and build a movie app. 

--------------------------------
# The Movie Application
I fetched the movie data from the API then walked through the data. I decided to display movies in cards in different categories such as popular, trending, top-rated and upcoming (which was much easier). I created the cards page and display pages for above mentioned categories. Then i tried to create carousel using 'react responsive carousel'. I placed search component in the home page. 

I used:
fetch() to fetch apis
useState and useEffect
react responsive carousel
